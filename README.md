Project by Paul Asquin for Awabot - May 2018 paul.asquin@gmail.com  

This project automates scene downloading of the ScanNet dataset usiing the download-scannet.py script.

The script download_from_txts.py reads "any.txt" files in the same folder as itself and downloads given scene_ids in the folder "Any".
