# I.Introduction  
This repo is a part of the Room Classification Project. 
The aim of the Room Classification Project is to make an indoor mobile robot able to recognize a room using its 2D map. 
The output of the 2D map given should be "Kitchen", "Bedroom", "Batroom", etc.  

In order to achieve this goal, we have chosen to use Machine Learning techniques in order to obtain a powerfull recognition system with no hard-coded rules.  

As for every Machine Learning project, we need adapted datasets and a learning algorithm.  

Here is the overall architecture of the project :
